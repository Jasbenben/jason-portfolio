    "As a co-founder and product lead, I oversaw the design, user experience, and feature direction. I studied how existing toolkits failed, mapped out what creators actually needed, and built a simpler, more intuitive workflow. I hired and coordinated with a Solana developer, reviewed code decisions with him, and ensured cross-platform compatibility across multiple launchpad environments.",
    "The project was ultimately sunset after early testing showed limited product-market fit, but it was a valuable exercise in product design, cross-chain tooling, and understanding the Solana developer ecosystem."

    Information

    Octo Tools was an experimental Solana toolkit 
    designed to make token launches easier, safer, 
    and more controlled for creators. The goal was to 
    give developers a clean interface for planning 
    launch strategies, running lightweight market-making 
    logic, and managing deployments across major 
    launchpads like Pump.fun and Bonk.fun...

    As a co-founder and product lead, I oversaw the 
    design, user experience, and feature direction...

    The project was ultimately sunset after early 
    testing showed limited product-market fit, but 
    it was a valuable exercise in product design...

    This prototype has been archived and is no longer live.

## Special Features

### Archived Project Handling

When a project has no links and includes "ARCHIVED" in its type field, the detail page automatically displays:

```
This prototype has been archived and is no longer live.
```

This replaces the Links section and makes it clear the project is sunset.

### No External Links

This project intentionally has no links section since it's archived. The system gracefully handles this by:
- Not showing a Links heading
- Showing the archived notice instead
- Maintaining clean spacing

## Current Portfolio Order

Your portfolio grid now shows:

1. **Lil Chillers AI NFT** → `/projects/lil-chillers-ai-nft`
2. **Jailbreak — AI Security Platform** → `/projects/jailbreak-ai-security-platform`
3. **Octo Tools — Solana Toolkit** → `/projects/octo-tools-solana-toolkit` ⭐ NEW
4. AI Agent Marketplace → `/projects/ai-agent-marketplace`
5. Workflow Orchestration Engine → `/projects/workflow-orchestration`

## Adding the Hero Image

The project is set to use:
```
/images/projects/octo-tools-hero.png
```

### To Add Your Image:

1. **Prepare your image:**
   - Recommended size: 1200x700px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Format: PNG, JPG, or WebP
   - Optimize for web (< 500KB if possible)

2. **Add to your project:**
   ```bash
   # Place your image file here:
   /Users/jason/jason portfolio/public/images/projects/octo-tools-hero.png
   ```

3. **Suggestions for archived projects:**
   - Consider a slightly desaturated/muted version of the interface
   - Add a subtle "Archived" watermark or overlay (optional)
   - Or use the original interface screenshot

## Key Highlights

### Product Leadership Focus
The content emphasizes your role as:
- ✅ Co-founder and product lead
- ✅ Design and UX oversight
- ✅ Feature direction and strategy
- ✅ Team coordination (hiring developer)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility work

### Honest About Sunset
The project transparently states:
- ✅ It was an experimental prototype
- ✅ Limited product-market fit led to sunset
- ✅ Valuable learnings were gained
- ✅ No longer live (archived notice)

### Technical Context
Highlights understanding of:
- ✅ Solana ecosystem
- ✅ Multi-launchpad deployment (Pump.fun, Bonk.fun)
- ✅ Token launch tooling
- ✅ Market-making logic
- ✅ Cross-chain compatibility

## Design Consistency

All colors match your existing design:
```css
Background:     #151617  (--bg-main)
Card:           #1A1C1D  (--bg-card)

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Project appears in correct position (3rd)
- ✅ Card shows "(Archived)" in title
- ✅ Tagline mentions "sunset prototype"
- ✅ Role displays correctly
- ✅ Clicking card navigates to detail page
- ✅ Detail page shows CATEGORY field
- ✅ All 3 information paragraphs display
- ✅ All 3 credits are listed
- ✅ Archived notice appears (no links section)
- ✅ Home button returns to main portfolio
- ✅ Responsive on mobile and desktop
- ✅ No linter errors

## Why This Project Matters

Including archived/sunset projects in your portfolio shows:
- **Transparency** - You're honest about outcomes
- **Learning mindset** - Value experiments even when they don't scale
- **Product skills** - Led product direction and design
- **Domain knowledge** - Understanding of Solana ecosystem
- **Team leadership** - Hired and coordinated with developers
- **Professional growth** - Shows progression and iteration

## Next Steps

1. **Add the hero image** to `/public/images/projects/octo-tools-hero.png`
2. **Test the page** at `http://localhost:3000/projects/octo-tools-solana-toolkit`
3. **Consider adding:** If you have any screenshots or mockups of the interface

## Optional Enhancements

If you want to add more context later, you could:
- Add a specific tech stack section
- Include screenshots of the interface (if available)
- List specific launchpads supported
- Add learnings section
- Include metrics (if any users/tests conducted)

---

**Your Octo Tools project is now in your portfolio! 🚀**

This transparently showcases your product leadership skills and Solana ecosystem experience, even for an archived prototype.
